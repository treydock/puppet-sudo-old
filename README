This module can be called by using

include sudo

== Definition usage ==

The sudo directives can be added in two ways, either by referencing the contents or file source


NOTE: The new line is necessary to avoid errors as puppet does not add it automatically
    sudo::directive { "zabbix-puppet":
        ensure  => present,
        content => "zabbix ALL=NOPASSWD: /var/lib/zabbix/bin/start_puppet\n",
    }   


    sudo::directive { "zabbix-puppet":
        ensure  => present,
        source  => "puppet:///files/zabbix_sudocmd",
    }
